	abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, {SHAP} ({SHapley} Additive {exPlanations}). {SHAP} assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

	abstract = {Isotropic chemical shifts measured by solution nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) spectroscopy offer extensive insights into protein structure and dynamics. Temperature dependences add a valuable dimension; notably, the temperature dependences of amide proton chemical shifts are valuable probes of hydrogen bonding, temperature‐dependent loss of structure, and exchange between distinct protein conformations. Accordingly, their uses include structural analysis of both folded and disordered proteins, and determination of the effects of mutations, binding, or solution conditions on protein energetics. Fundamentally, these temperature dependences result from changes in the local magnetic environments of nuclei, but correlations with global thermodynamic parameters measured via calorimetric methods have been observed. Although the temperature dependences of amide proton and nitrogen chemical shifts are often well approximated by a linear model, deviations from linearity are also observed and may be interpreted as evidence of fast exchange between distinct conformational states. Here, we describe computational methods, accessible via the Shift‐T web server, including an automated tracking algorithm that propagates initial (single temperature) 1H—15N cross peak assignments to spectra collected over a range of temperatures. Amide proton and nitrogen temperature coefficients (slopes determined by fitting chemical shift vs. temperature data to a linear model) are subsequently calculated. Also included are methods for the detection of systematic, statistically significant deviation from linearity (curvature) in the temperature dependences of amide proton chemical shifts. The use and utility of these methods are illustrated by example, and the Shift‐T web server is freely available at http://meieringlab.uwaterloo.ca/shiftt.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has revolutionized many machine learning tasks in recent years, ranging from image classification and video processing to speech recognition and natural language understanding. The data in these tasks are typically represented in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of applications, where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on the existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks ({GNNs}) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art {GNNs} into four categories, namely, recurrent {GNNs}, convolutional {GNNs}, graph autoencoders, and spatial-temporal {GNNs}. We further discuss the applications of {GNNs} across various domains and summarize the open-source codes, benchmark data sets, and model evaluation of {GNNs}. Finally, we propose potential research directions in this rapidly growing field.},

	abstract = {Supervised learning on molecules has incredible potential to be useful in chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science. Luckily, several promising and closely related neural network models invariant to molecular symmetries have already been described in the literature. These models learn a message passing algorithm and aggregation procedure to compute a function of their entire input graph. At this point, the next step is to find a particularly effective variant of this general approach and apply it to chemical prediction benchmarks until we either solve them or reach the limits of the approach. In this paper, we reformulate existing models into a single common framework we call Message Passing Neural Networks ({MPNNs}) and explore additional novel variations within this framework. Using {MPNNs} we demonstrate state of the art results on an important molecular property prediction benchmark; these results are strong enough that we believe future work should focus on datasets with larger molecules or more accurate ground truth labels.},

	abstract = {A computer-assisted approach to the prediction of the primary structures of regular glycopolymers is described. The analysis is based on comparing the calculated 13C {NMR} spectra of all the possible structures of the repeating unit (for the given monomeric composition) to an experimental 13C {NMR} spectrum. The spectra generation is based on the spectral database containing information on the 13C chemical shifts of monomers, di- and trimeric fragments. If the required data are missing from this database, the special database for average glycosylation effects is used. The analysis reveals those structures with the calculated 13C {NMR} spectrum most close to observed. The structures of repeating units of any topology containing up to six residues linked by glycosidic, amidic or phospho-diester bridges can be predicted. Unambiguous selection of the proper structure from the output list of possible structures may require additional experimental data. Testing the created program and databases on bacterial polysaccharides and their derivatives containing up to three non-sugar residues (alditols, amino acids, phosphate groups etc.) per repeating unit revealed the good convergence of prediction with independently obtained structural data.},

The relative ease of sample preparation, the ability to quantify metabolite levels, the high level of experimental reproducibility, and the inherently nondestructive nature of {NMR} spectroscopy have made it the preferred platform for long-term or large-scale clinical metabolomic studies. These advantages, however, are often outweighed by the fact that most other analytical techniques, including both {LC}-{MS} and {GC}-{MS}, are inherently more sensitive than {NMR}, with lower limits of detection typically being 10 to 100 times better.

It will also explore some of the unique strengths of {NMR}-based metabolomics, particularly with regard to isotope selection/detection, mixture deconvolution via 2D spectroscopy, automation, and the ability to noninvasively analyze native tissue specimens.

	abstract = {Proteins adopt different higher-order structures ({HOS}) to enable their unique biological functions. Understanding the complexities of protein higher-order structures and dynamics requires integrated approaches, where mass spectrometry ({MS}) is now positioned to play a key role. One of those approaches is protein footprinting. Although the initial demonstration of footprinting was for the {HOS} determination of protein/nucleic acid binding, the concept was later adapted to {MS}-based protein {HOS} analysis, through which different covalent labeling approaches “mark” the solvent accessible surface area ({SASA}) of proteins to reflect protein {HOS}. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange ({HDX}), where deuterium in D2O replaces hydrogen of the backbone amides, is the most common example of footprinting. Its advantage is that the footprint reflects {SASA} and hydrogen bonding, whereas one drawback is the labeling is reversible. Another example of footprinting is slow irreversible labeling of functional groups on amino acid side chains by targeted reagents with high specificity, probing structural changes at selected sites. A third footprinting approach is by reactions with fast, irreversible labeling species that are highly reactive and footprint broadly several amino acid residue side chains on the time scale of submilliseconds. All of these covalent labeling approaches combine to constitute a problem-solving toolbox that enables mass spectrometry as a valuable tool for {HOS} elucidation. As there has been a growing need for {MS}-based protein footprinting in both academia and industry owing to its high throughput capability, prompt availability, and high spatial resolution, we present a summary of the history, descriptions, principles, mechanisms, and applications of these covalent labeling approaches. Moreover, their applications are highlighted according to the biological questions they can answer. This review is intended as a tutorial for {MS}-based protein {HOS} elucidation and as a reference for investigators seeking a {MS}-based tool to address structural questions in protein science.},

Here, we review the recent advances and illustrate the exciting new opportunities that they offer to structural biology research.},

Structural insights of biological samples not accessible by conventional X-ray crystallography and {NMR} can be explored with cryo-{EM} because measurements are carried out under near-native crystal-free conditions, and large protein complexes with conformational and compositional heterogeneity are readily resolved. {RNA} has remained underexplored in cryo-{EM}, despite its essential role in various biological processes. This review highlights current challenges and recent progress in using cryo-{EM} single-particle analysis to determine protein-free {RNA} structures, enabled by improvement in sample preparation and integration of multiple structural and biochemical methods.},

This {RDF} standard is defined by the {GlycoRDF} ontology and will be used by database providers to generate common machine-readable exports of the data stored in their databases.Availability and implementation: The ontology, supporting documentation and source code used by database providers to generate standardized {RDF} are available online (http://www.glycoinfo.org/{GlycoRDF}/).Contact:rene@ccrc.uga.edu or kkiyoko@soka.ac.{jpSupplementary} information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
